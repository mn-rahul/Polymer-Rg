 # Sequence Structure Co-relation of Polymer
 
 ### Data : Sequence Chain Polymer. It consists of a chain of two different monomers represented by 1 and 2
and the value for Rg of the polymer. Contains 100 sequential 1s and 2s and the value of Rg for
the polymer which is the target variable. Each sequence was in an individual txt file, I have imported it and converted it into a pandas dataframe.
